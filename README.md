## About the language

> _Describe the language_
>     This language is object oriented. Scala uses java. Java has its own problems with OOP.
      In Scala, all data are objects belonging to some class. All computation occurs in some method invocation.   
      
      Uses 
      Symbols - a name of a variable that refer that to some data
      Binding - an association of a symbol to some specific data
      Scopes - a set of bindings such that each symbol is assicated to a unique data value.
      
      
>- History
> - Some interesting features
      Uses Function concepts such as Lambda Calculus, Immutable data, Closure, Function as values.
